However, the fast rate of normal mouse heart at 400–600 bpm limits its capacity of assessing kinetic parameters that are important for the physiology and pathophysiology of human heart that beats at a much slower rate (75–180 bpm). To extend the value of mouse models, we established a protocol to study ex vivo mouse working hearts at a human-like heart rate. In the presence of 300 μM lidocaine to lower pacemaker and conductive activities and prevent arrhythmia, a stable rate of 120–130 bpm at 37 °C is achieved for ex vivo mouse working hearts. The negative effects of decreased heart rate on force-frequency dependence and lidocaine as a myocardial depressant on intracellular calcium can be compensated by using a higher but still physiological level of calcium (2.75 mM) in the perfusion media. Multiple parameters were studied to compare the function at the human-like heart rate with that of ex vivo mouse working hearts at the standard rate of 480 bpm. The results showed that the conditions for slower heart rate in the presence of 300 μM lidocaine did not have depressing effect on left ventricular pressure development, systolic and diastolic velocities and stroke volume with maintained positive inotropic and lusitropic responses to β-adrenergic stimulation. Compared with that at 480 bpm, the human-like heart rate increased ventricular filling and end diastolic volume with enhanced Frank-Starling responses. Coronary perfusion was increased from longer relaxation time and interval between beats whereas cardiac efficiency was significantly improved. Although the intrinsic differences between mouse and human heart remain, this methodology for ex vivo mouse hearts to work at human-like heart rate extends the value of using genetically modified mouse models to study cardiac function and human heart diseases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Animals; Calcium; Cardiac Pacing, Artificial; Diastole; Female; Heart; Heart Rate; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Lidocaine; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Myocardial Contraction; Perfusion; Systole; lidocaine; calcium; lidocaine; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; beta adrenergic stimulation; calcium cell level; comparative study; controlled study; coronary artery blood flow; diastolic blood pressure; ex vivo study; female; heart arrhythmia; heart contraction; heart disease; heart function; heart left ventricle filling; heart rate; heart ventricle enddiastolic pressure; heart ventricle pressure; human; inotropism; male; methodology; mouse; nonhuman; peak systolic velocity; physiology; priority journal; prophylaxis; Starling law; animal; C57BL mouse; diastole; drug effect; heart; heart pacing; heart rate; heart ventricle; metabolism; perfusion; physiology; systole","Cardiac function; Ex vivo mouse working heart; Heart rate; Left ventricular contractile parameters; Lidocaine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034835099"

The aim of the present study is to identify functionally and pathologically important heart-specific genes by performing the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Through a median-based analysis of tissue-specific gene expression based on the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data, we identified 56 genes with heart-specific or elevated expressions in the heart (heart-specific/enhanced), among which three common heart-specific/enhanced genes and four atrial appendage-specific/enhanced genes were unreported regarding the heart. Differential expression analysis further revealed 225 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between atrial appendage and left ventricle. Our integrative analyses of those heart-specific/enhanced genes and DEGs with IPA revealed enriched heart-related traits and diseases, consolidating evidence of relationships between these genes and heart function. Our reports on comprehensive identification of heart-specific/enhanced genes and DEGs and their relation to pathways associated with heart-related traits and diseases provided molecular insights into essential regulators of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology and potential new therapeutic targets for heart diseases. © Copyright © 2020 Ahn, Wu and Lee.","bone morphogenetic protein; fibroblast growth factor; fibroblast growth factor 23; heat shock protein 90; long untranslated RNA; myosin heavy chain; myosin light chain; transcriptome; transfer RNA; tumor necrosis factor; actin polymerization; AMPK signaling; aortic valve; Article; atrial fibrillation; bioinformatics; cell differentiation; congenital heart disease; congenital myasthenic syndrome; data analysis; data collection method; down regulation; gene; gene expression; gene identification; gene ontology; gene overexpression; genotype; heart; heart atrium appendage; heart atrium flutter; heart contraction; heart development; heart failure; heart function; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart muscle contractility; heart muscle fibrosis; heart protection; heart rate; heart ventricle hypertrophy; heart ventricle septum defect; human; hypoxia; pathophysiology; phenotype; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; signal transduction; upregulation","differentially expressed genes; gene expression; heart disease; heart-specific genes; ingenuity pathway analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089426213"

Nevertheless, cardiac dysfunction (and ultimately heart failure) is a common complication in the SV population, and pharmacological heart failure therapies have largely been ineffective in mitigating the need for heart transplantation. Given that there are several inherent risk factors for ventricular dysfunction in the setting of SV in addition to probable differences in molecular adaptations to heart failure between children and adults, it is perhaps not surprising that extrapolated adult heart failure medications have had limited benefit in children with SV heart failure. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms involved in pediatric SV heart failure may assist with risk stratification as well as development of targeted, efficacious therapies specific to this patient population. In this review, we present a brief overview of SV anatomy and physiology, with a focus on patients with a single morphological right ventricle requiring staged surgical palliation. Additionally, we discuss outcomes in the current era, risk factors associated with the progression to heart failure, present state of knowledge regarding molecular alterations in end-stage SV heart failure, and current therapeutic interventions. Potential avenues for improving SV outcomes, including identification of biomarkers of heart failure progression, implications of personalized medicine and stem cell-derived therapies, and applications of novel models of SV disease, are proposed as future directions.

In the study period from 1 July 2009 to 31 December 2012, 82 children out of 18 815 presented with heart disease, which was a prevalence of 4.3/1 000. There was a female predominance, with a ratio of 1.2. The most frequent presenting conditions were dyspnoea at 47.5%, followed by heart murmurs at 35.3%, and congestive heart failure at 13.4%. Congenital heart diseases were the most frequent, representing 69.5% of the cases, followed by acquired heart diseases at 29.3%, and mixed-type cases at 1.2%. The most frequently encountered congenital heart diseases were ventricular septal defect (24.4%), followed by atrioventricular septal defect (12.2%), tetralogy of Fallot (9.8%) and patent ductus arteriosus (7.3%). Acquired heart disease was represented by rheumatic heart disease, found in 25.6% of the cases, and tuberculous pericarditis in 3.7%.

The number of donor hearts which are primarily procured from donation after brain death (DBD) donors is limited, but donation after circulatory death (DCD) donor hearts can increase the heart donor pool. However, ischemia and reperfusion injuries associated with the DCD process causes myocardial damage, limiting the use of DCD hearts in transplantation. Addressing this problem is critical in the exploration of DCD hearts as suitable donor hearts for transplantation. In this study, rat hearts were procured following the control beating-heart donor (CBD) or DCD donation process. Changes in mitochondria and cardiac function from DCD hearts subjected to 25 or 35 minutes of ischemia followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion were compared to CBD hearts. Following ischemia, rates of oxidative phosphorylation and calcium retention capacity were progressively impaired in DCD hearts compared to CBD hearts. Reperfusion caused additional mitochondrial dysfunction in DCD hearts. Developed pressure, inotropy and lusitropy, were significantly reduced in DCD hearts compared to CBD hearts. We, therefore, suggest that interventional strategies targeted before the onset of ischemia and at reperfusion could protect mitochondria, thus potentially making DCD hearts suitable for heart transplantation.  © 2020 Akande et al.","Animals; Brain Death; Calcium; Heart; Heart Rate; Heart Transplantation; Hydrogen Peroxide; Male; Mitochondria; Myocardial Contraction; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reperfusion Injury; Time Factors; Tissue and Organ Procurement; Tissue Donors; Ventricular Function, Left; Warm Ischemia; calcium ion; calcium; hydrogen peroxide; animal experiment; animal model; Article; controlled study; disorders of mitochondrial functions; experimental study; heart contraction; heart death; heart function; heart mitochondrion; heart muscle relaxation; heart muscle reperfusion; heart transplantation; in vitro study; in vivo study; inotropy; lusitropy; male; myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury; non heart beating donor; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; rat; animal; brain death; donor; heart; heart left ventricle function; heart rate; ischemia; metabolism; mitochondrion; physiology; procedures; reperfusion injury; Sprague Dawley rat; time factor; transplantation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098967912"

Heart rate is finely modulated by neurohormonal signals and it reflects the balance between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic limbs of the autonomic nervous system. For this reason, elevated heart rate in heart failure has been considered an epiphenomenon of the sympathetic hyperactivation during heart failure. However, experimental and clinical evidence suggests that high heart rate could have a direct pathogenetic role. Consequently, heart rate might act as a pathophysiological mediator of heart failure as well as a marker of adverse outcome. This hypothesis has been supported by the observation that the positive effect of beta-blockade could be linked to the degree of heart rate reduction. In addition, the selective heart rate control with ivabradine has recently been demonstrated to be beneficial in patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Theoretically ideal heart rate was calculated using a previously proposed formula: 93 − 0.13 × (deceleration time [msec]). Impacts of heart rate on the 1-year echocardiographic left ventricular reverse remodeling were compared among the three groups stratified by the heart rate status: optimal heart rate group (within 10 bpm of ideal heart rate), below-optimal heart rate group (< 10 bpm of ideal heart rate), and above-optimal heart rate group (> 10 bpm of ideal heart rate). A total of 75 patients (70 years old, 60 men) were included.

Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (from 55 to 54) and left ventricular ejection fraction (from 39 to 46) improved significantly only in the optimal heart rate group at 1-year follow-up (p < 0.05 for both). Optimal heart rate, which was calculated using a formula consisting of deceleration time, was associated with cardiac reverse remodeling in patients with systolic heart failure. Prospective study to investigate the implication of deceleration time-guided aggressive heart rate optimization is the next concern. © 2021, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Aged; Heart Failure; Heart Failure, Systolic; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Stroke Volume; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Remodeling; brain natriuretic peptide; ivabradine; tolvaptan; aged; Article; clinical outcome; controlled study; deceleration; echocardiography; female; follow up; functional assessment; general condition improvement; heart arrhythmia; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic diameter; heart rate; heart rate measurement; heart ventricle remodeling; hemodynamics; human; immunotherapy; major clinical study; male; modulation; prevalence; process optimization; prospective study; retrospective study; systolic heart failure; heart failure; heart left ventricle function; heart rate; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle remodeling; physiology; systolic heart failure","Arrhythmia; Hemodynamics; Ivabradine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105436255"
